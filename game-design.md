# Overview

## 📐 Project scope

- **Timeline: Needs to built within 5 working days from the request**
- **Budget: None**

## 🗣️ Elevator Pitch

This is a simple game. A player is expected to shoot other space ships to collect more scores.

## 💵 Monetization

I create this game only to learn how to build a web application with JavaScript and Phaser 3. Monetization is not under concern for now.

# Story

In Space, there are a lot of space ships but not all of them are friends with each other. So there is one hero who should save his planet from enemies. To save his world he should shoot as many as enemies.

# Gameplay

In this game, you should shoot Carrier Ship, Gun Ship and Chaser Ship. But the scariest enemy is Chaser Ship because it chases you until you die. So you should be serious with Chaser ship. I think if you play the game you love it because it gives you the feeling of the past century.
